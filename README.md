# Football-logo-identification
Football Logo Identification is a Python project that utilizes the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to identify and match football team logos in images. This project aims to provide a robust and accurate solution for recognizing football logos, even in cases of scaling, rotation, or partial occlusion.

## Introduction

Football Logo Identification is a practical application of computer vision and image processing techniques to recognize and match football team logos in images. It is designed to be versatile and capable of handling various football team logos, making it useful for sports analytics, branding, marketing, fan engagement, and merchandising.

## Features

- Identification of football team logos using SIFT features.
- Database creation for storing logo features, image names, and keypoints.
- Robust logo matching for scaled, rotated, and partially occluded logos.
- Visualization of matches between an input image and logos in the database.
